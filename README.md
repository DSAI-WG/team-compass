# The DSAI Working Group Compass
This meta-repository is meant to help us organize ourselves across the many consortia, projects, and use-cases in the NFDI community. It's meant to make the project more welcoming, transparent, and inclusive. If you've got an idea for how this can be improved, [please reach out](https://github.com/DSAI-WG/team-compass/issues/new/choose)!
